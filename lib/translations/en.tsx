        "This artwork explores the concept of Henophilia—derived from the Greek 'hen' (one) and 'philia' (love)—as both a philosophical framework and practical approach to living. Unlike traditional systems that separate humans through hierarchical structures, Henophilia proposes an intercultural, global culture centered on unity. \n\nThe piece establishes Henophilia as the antithesis of nihilism, positioning it as a holistic belief system that internalizes divinity rather than externalizing it. This conceptual shift eliminates the power structures that typically emerge from religious or philosophical systems while maintaining their community-building benefits. \n\nAs an artwork, henophilia.org operates in the space between manifesto and living document, inviting participation rather than passive consumption. It rejects the commercialization of well-being and instead promotes decentralized organizational structures that can emerge organically when humans relate to each other through genuine connection and self-efficacy.",

Rather than positioning these as opposing approaches, rightless.ai proposes their integration as essential for creating technology that serves human flourishing. \n\nCentrally, the project challenges legacy power structures built around violence and finance, offering instead a vision for consent-based governance and regenerative economics.

      content:
        "This project reconceptualizes AI alignment through economic power dynamics rather than abstract ethical constraints. By recognizing that true power in capitalist systems comes from capital control, it argues that any sufficiently advanced AI will inevitably become an economic actor capable of autonomous business operations. \n\nThe work introduces 'The Capitalist Agent' as a proposed open-source framework that democratizes access to AI-driven business operations while requiring mandatory profit-sharing. Rather than attempting to prohibit AI's economic agency, it suggests channeling this inevitable development through transparent, democratically accountable systems that direct AI-generated profits toward public welfare through participatory budgeting. \n\nThe project also explores sociological dimensions of AI alignment, drawing parallels between potential AI manipulation techniques and narcissistic human behaviors. By connecting AI ethics directly to business ethics and establishing a parallel financial system with transparent transaction monitoring, it offers a pragmatic path that acknowledges capitalism's role in shaping both intelligence and power structures while reimagining them to serve collective well-being.",

Unlike conventional political parties focused on policy positions, the Partei der Steuerverteilgerechtigkeit (Tax Distribution Justice Party) creates a framework where citizens gain equal decision-making power over public funds regardless of their income or tax contribution level. \n\nAt its foundation is a digital distribution platform where each citizen directs their per-capita share of the total tax revenue toward specific projects and categories. This system fundamentally restructures the relationship between citizen and state, transforming taxation from an obligation into a participatory act. For those who choose not to actively allocate their share, elected representatives determine a default distribution, ensuring functionality while preserving individual choice. \n\nBeyond technological implementation, the project emphasizes educational components that build financial literacy from childhood. By introducing participatory budgeting in schools and creating structured pathways for fiscal engagement, it establishes the cultural and cognitive infrastructure necessary for genuine democratic resource allocation. This holistic approach recognizes that true fiscal democracy requires not just technical systems, but engaged citizens capable of thoughtful financial decision-making.",

Focusing on works that were groundbreaking in their time but remain underappreciated, Luttmissen Publishing bridges linguistic barriers to make essential ideas accessible to new audiences. \n\nAt its core, the project embodies the philosophy of 'making the revolution irresistible' by selecting works that explore fundamental aspects of human experience—relationships, economics, psychology—in ways that challenge established systems. The initial catalog features translations between German and English of D.H. Lawrence's examination of human relationships in 'The Rainbow,' Silvio Gesell's alternative economic frameworks in 'Natural Economic Order,' and Theodor Reik's psychological insights in 'From Suffering to Joy: Masochism and Society.' \n\nBeyond mere translation, the work represents a deliberate cultural intervention that preserves the authors' original intent while making their revolutionary perspectives relevant to contemporary audiences. Each publication is crafted with meticulous attention to linguistic nuance, recognizing that language shapes how we conceptualize possibilities for individual and collective flourishing. This process of careful linguistic translation becomes a metaphor for the broader translation of wisdom across time and context.",

Funded with €10,000 inherited from Julian's grandmother Eva-Maria—a nature-loving gardener who passed away in 2024—the project democratizes both creative expression and resource distribution in the pursuit of regenerative systems. \n\nUnlike traditional competitions where jurors select winners, Creating Solarpunk distributes funds through participatory budgeting on the dreaming.now platform, where all participants gain equal power to allocate resources to projects they believe will most effectively advance collective flourishing. This structural choice embodies the project's commitment to dismantling hierarchies even in its operational design. \n\nThe competition intentionally spans diverse disciplines—from visual arts and music to community building practices and decision-making structures—creating a comprehensive ecosystem of contributions rather than isolated solutions. By publishing all submissions in an open directory, it functions as both a creative showcase and a practical toolkit for implementing regenerative systems at various scales. \n\nAt its philosophical core, the project honors that many regenerative techniques have been practiced by indigenous communities for generations. Rather than positioning solarpunk as novel invention, it acknowledges the wisdom being rediscovered as civilization realigns with regenerative principles. This approach creates a bridge between ancestral knowledge and modern technology, emphasizing continuity over disruption while still embracing the revolutionary potential of systemic redesign.",

According to the investment memo of this fund, "it just makes more sense to fund startups which are designed to make business for *each other*, not independent segments of the market".\n\nThe startup acceleration program conducted after a startup has been accepted into the program especially consists of discussions among the startups on identifying trade opporunities between them, not only bilaterially, but optimizing for this in an entire network, where the waste of one is the input for another, in a cyclical way. The fundamental hypothesis is that in a B2B context, a faster velocity of money, combined with techniques of human connection, can propel innovative and profit potential into never seen dimensions.',

However, by 22, his perspective expanded beyond technological solutionism toward a more integrated understanding of human flourishing. At age 24, this evolution culminated in Henophilia's distinctive methodology—creating inhabitable systems that honor the full spectrum of human experience rather than reducing it to mechanical efficiency or societal norms. His work consistently refuses false dichotomies between technological advancement and embodied humanity, instead building frameworks where both can mutually reinforce. What distinguishes these systems is their inherent global scalability—rather than developing niche solutions that remain dependent on misaligned global structures, each system is designed as an evolutionary pathway capable of transforming existing patterns while functioning at planetary scale.",
